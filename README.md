# LiBerry - Your Personal Book Manager!
A place to store to your reading list and keep track of the books you've read or would like to read.

The Project utilizes vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The app is pretty simple. It features a simplistic design, with just a side bar and a main window where your books will be stored. On the side bar you can see two buttons, one for adding books that reveals a form in the center of the right larger area beside the sidebar, and one to enter edit mode where you'll be able to delete any unwanted entries. The cards will align in rows, displaying The title, author, pages, and your read/reading status.

Heres a gif of how it works!
